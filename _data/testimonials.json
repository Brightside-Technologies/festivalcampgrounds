Everyone was super friendly and helpful and genuinely cared about our wellbeing every night and morning. The beauty bar, ice buckets and 24 hour security were amazing and an added feature we were not even aware was going to happen! We loved every minute and will 150% be back!",

The bathrooms were very nice (always clean and stocked with TP and towels) and the access to the ice machine was such a bonus! I also really appreciated having security there at night, the guard was really personable and made me feel totally safe. I’ll definitely be staying here again next year!",
